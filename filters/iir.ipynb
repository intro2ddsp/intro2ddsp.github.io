    "It is also called recursive system because the output samples are recursively computed from past output samples.\n",

    "The last two equations are ugly but thankfully we will not need them in this notebook.\n",

    "You can see that the output samples $y[n]$ are a weighted sum of the current and past input samples $x[n], x[n-1], \\dots$, just like in the FIR case.\n",
    "However, the length of the impulse response is infinite, hence the name IIR.\n",

    "IIRs are very useful because use can approximate long FIRs with much less number of coefficients in an IIR.\n",
    "This also implies that they are cheaper to compute."
