  abstract = {Neural source-filter (NSF) models are deep neural networks that produce waveforms given input acoustic features. They use dilated-convolution-based neural filter modules to filter sinebased excitation for waveform generation, which is different from WaveNet and flow-based models. One of the NSF models, called harmonic-plus-noise NSF (h-NSF) model, uses separate pairs of source and neural filters to generate harmonic and noise waveform components. It is close to WaveNet in terms of speech quality while being superior in generation speed.},
