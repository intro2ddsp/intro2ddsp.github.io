# Digital Synthesizer Modelling

In this chapter we'll look at how a digital synthesizer for musical instrument synthesis 
can be implemented using the PyTorch library and how we can use gradient descent optimization
to learn parameters for this synthesizer to match a target sound.
We'll build on what we learned in the introduction PyTorch chapter and work up
to the development of a harmonic synthesizer similar to the one used by {cite:t}`engel_ddsp_2020`
to model instrument tones.
Over the next few sections we'll build up the core components of this harmonic synthesizer,
starting from a simple sinusoidal oscillator.
Our goal will be to use our synthesizer with gradient descent and an audio loss function
to reproduce instrumental sounds from real recordings.

**Can our synthesizer recreate these sounds?**

## Sinusoidal Modelling Synthesis
There are many different types of audio synthesis. One method that has been particularly
fruitful in differentiable synthesis of musical instruments is sinusoidal modeling synthesis (SMS),
initially developed by {cite:t}`serra_spectral_1990` in the late 1980s.
The core idea of SMS is based on Fourier's theorem, which states that any sound can
be decomposed into a set of sinusoidal basis components.
SMS leverages this concept within an analysis-synthesis pipeline to model instrumental
sounds by summing together sets of time-varying sinusoidal components.

{cite:t}`engel_ddsp_2020` used a variant of a sinusoidal modelling synthesizer called a **harmonic synthesizer**,
which essentially restricts the sinusoidal components to be integer multiples of a
fundamental frequency, and made it differentiable. Engel et al. motivated this decision
based on the knowledge that most musical sounds are periodic in nature and that embedding
sinusoidal oscillators within a neural audio synthesizer provides a useful inductive bias
towards the generation of those sounds.

In this chapter we will look at developing this differentiable harmonic synthesizer proposed
by Engel et al.

If we look at the full model diagram from the original DDSP paper by {cite:t}`engel_ddsp_2020`,
we are going to focus on developing the block component labelled **Harmonic Audio** and look
at how we can use the **Multi-Scale Spectrogram Loss** to learn parameters to match the
sounds we introduced above!

Sinusoidal modelling is also just one of many synthesis methods that we can model 
differentiably. Some of these alternative methods will be overviewed and we will also
introduce a couple open-source libraries which have implemented some core signal processing
objects into composable differentiable modular synthesizers.
