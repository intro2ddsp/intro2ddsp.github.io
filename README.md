### Dependencies

For ease of installation in multiple environments, dependencies should be included in the `requirements.txt` file. Dependencies should be kept to a minimum. Ideally, top-level imports should include only `jupyter`, `torch`, `torchaudio`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. Notebooks should be self-contained and not rely on any other local modules or relative imports.
